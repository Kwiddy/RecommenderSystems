This location was not the easiest for me to get to but I made the effort to check it out.  A cover charge and dress code is in effect on Friday & Saturday party nights.

Several large TV screens were showing an NFL game, the Raptors game and the Leafs game.

Ultra premium bar rail is $7.30 all day every day and only $5.75 during Hooch Hour from 5-7pm and 10-11pm nightly.  If tap is your fancy, choose from several draughts and ciders on tap.  Others may prefer a 6 oz Hooch Hour wine for $5.75 or bottled wines which they mark up $30 from LCBO prices.

Party shots of Jagermeister and JD Tennessee Honey are $2.88 all day every day.

Off the dinner menu, I chose an Inside-Out Pulled Pork Grilled Cheese Handheld with Duck Fat Frites for $16.95.  My friend is having the Fish and Avocado Tacos for $15.95.  Very nice..and delicious.

Overall, it's a different crowd here and I really liked it.  The place started to get packed about 9:45 p.m. just as the DJ arrived to set up.  A dance floor is located at the back to strut your stuff to the great music.

Bar staff were friendly (especially Amanda) and service was excellent!",2019-01-06 03:28:23

Ambience: 4 Stars
Fill Factor: Satisfied

I have been here several times (mostly for wings night on Wednesdays) and have to say my experience here has mostly been positive.

As I mentioned, I have been here a few times for wings and they offer forty different flavours and each order comes with veggie sticks and a dipping sauce. I must say I did enjoy the flavours of the wings with some of my favourites being Maple BBQ, Peri Peri and Momofuku (might be an acquired taste). I have also had their tacos which I did not enjoy as much (if you have to choose one though go with the fish) as well I tried the crispy chicken sandwich. The sandwich was good as the chicken was fairly crispy and there was a nice sweet taste to it. It got a bit messy as they put a lot of coleslaw in it.

Service is decent here considering how packed it gets on wings nights. The food takes a bit of time to get here but it could be a lot worse. There is a ton of seating as there are two floors in this place. The walls are crammed full of sports memorabilia and lots of TVs to watch the game on.

Overall, this is a pretty cool place to hang out with friends. The place is usually lively and the food is not bad here. A pretty good choice if you are looking for a sports bar in the area.",2019-01-11 03:13:48

Extremely disappointing, but then again I shouldn't have had my hopes any where near up.
Went for a recent Trivia Night (Marvel) and had some food, so lets break this up into 3 sections: Trivia Night, Food, and Service

Trivia
$5 entry fee/person. Chance to win one of 3 prizes (which would make the entry fee viable). BUT the number of teams (20+) means the chances of winning a prize to be laughably low. Many other formats of pub trivia work, this one doesn't. 

Food:
Low quality, over-priced.

Service:
Atrocious. The server broke 3 server rules (for me). 1. laughed at my question. 2. told me I was wrong. 3. broke the cardinal server sin
in more detail:

1. My question was 'What kind of Craft Sodas do you have'. A little bit of a pretentious question, but one that can be used to gauge the kind of server and establishment. When asked the server laughed, and said they just have normal sodas. It doesn't matter that a place doesn't offer craft soda's (or rather it does matter but that argument is for another time). But how a server reacts to that question can speak volumes, rather than say something like, 'sorry, we focus on craft beers, but do have a selection of coke products' the server laughing at the question simply makes the server look unprofessional. Not a good start.

2. Once my soda did arrive it tasted off, too much soda water and not enough syrup. Little background here: I am a grown-ass man who has worked in multiple restaurants/pubs for many years and have been drinking pops/sodas my whole life. I know when a fountain machine is mis-calibrated, or due to recent change of syrup/CO2 the gin can produce a bad glass. It is relatively common and so a good bartender will keep an eye on their fountain guns to ensure they are serving a decent product. When I told the server 'this tastes wrong, like there is too much soda'. She 'checked' and told me 'the syrup isn't out, so you probably just don't like it, so what else would you like?'. hu? I'm telling you there is something wrong with the drink, and you are telling me there is something wrong with me. nice. Did the server (or bartender) test? nope. Did the server offer me another pour of the drink? nope. All in all i declined any drink.

3. You may disagree with the above 2 points, citing I am just being picky, and you may be right. But the next point is one of those egregious mistakes that any server should be taught day 1 of training. 
I paid cash for my bill. $20 for a $16.95. The server asked 'do you need me to bring change?'. This is a no-no. This is akin to asking 'can I keep the change?' The correct thing to say at this juncture is 'I will be right back with your change'. The assumption should be that the patron wants their money back, and this gives the patron the opportunity to say 'no, thanks that's fine' (or similar). This is the interaction upon which I will judge a server, and one in which this server failed. The server also failed basic math and brought back $3 as oppose to $3.05. yup 5cents. The smallest cash denomination available. Do I care? no. Is it worth noting in a review? yes. Either the server needed the money -in which case: fair-play. Or they were too lazy to pick up the nickel, or didn't want to tell me they don't have a nickel in the till -in which case: *sigh

I also love that I could happily order an entire bottle of champagne for myself and was even served in a bottle service bucket since my friend and I felt like being extra.

While I enjoy a free meal, I would much rather pay for a quality meal than be comped for a poor one. Sadly, my expectations have been completely reset. On my last visit I ordered the duck poutine - sounded delicious! Problem was it arrived without any duck and was just a messy bowl of fries, cheese and gravy. I asked the waitress who apologized and said the kitchen could get a side bowl of duck ready for me in 20 minutes while my poutine went cold. Apparently doing the the full order again was out of the question. Well, there was free meal # 1.

The visit before I went for the fish and chips. The batter on the fish was not even close to cooked and was still a paste when it arrived. The waitress who dropped it off looked at the plate and apologized before I could even mention it.  Again, I was comped for the meal but would have rather just paid for an edible one.

Being a recognized regular in the bar, several months ago one of the managers approached me and asked if I would be kind enough to do a survey with Parcel Designs, one of Prohibition's third party partners who were evaluating the bar. In exchange, I would get a $50 gift card for Prohibition mailed to me. Well the survey was completed back in July and I'm still waiting to receive it. I mentioned it last month to the same manager who took down my contact info and guess what....still nothing.

Shame about this place going downhill so rapidly. The hooch hour selection is sadly the only redeeming quality left. That is, unless you enjoy meals so poorly prepared the staff offers to take it off the bill before you even complain.",2019-11-13 18:28:07

The upstairs had an arcade style set up with pinball machines that cost around a buck a play which was a good way to kill some time while you wait for your server just to give you menus....and boy did we wait!  I ended up going up to one of the wait staff asking if we can get two menus and she proceeded to tell me practically sneering no less that ""we shouldn't have seated ourselves as that only applies to the bar stool section only""  I proceeded to tell her you should really take that up with the hostess downstairs who at that time sent several people upstairs who all proceeded to seat themselves.    

Menu is pretty basic pub/sports bar style food and we ordered wings and drinks that took equally as long to arrive with some of the wings so burnt that was all you were able to taste.   We didn't bother returning them because at that point we were already there for 2.5 hours by the time our mains arrived (Yes the wait was that long!).

We ordered two beers and at 12:15 we ordered lunch. The place started to fill up with people going to the game but we felt confident that we would get our food before most since we had been there so long. 

At 1:20 we still hadn't gotten our food and both our beers were gone and not one bartender stopped to ask if we wanted a refill. We had to try very hard to flag down a bartender. We asked how much longer for the food and she said she would ask but that the kitchen was pretty backed up at the moment. 

She never got back to us so at 1:30 we asked for the check for the two beers and to forget about the food. Not only did we have someplace to be at 2 but waiting over an hour (at a sports bar) for some very basic food items is not acceptible in any situation.

The Service:
The service was really good and our waitress placed our orders relatively quickly and she continued to fill our glasses throughout the night. Our food also arrived really quickly, which allowed us to enjoy the beautiful ambiance. 

The Ambiance:
The restaurant is really nice and has a romantic feel. It is definitely the perfect place for a nice enjoyable date night. 

The Food:
We ordered a margarita flatbread pizza (this was loaded with gluten and dairy) for my boyfriend and a cauliflower steak for myself. 

My boyfriend really enjoyed his flatbread pizza. The portion was huge and he said it was really good. I asked him how it compares to his favourite pizza restaurant and he said it was good but not as good as his favourite pizzeria. He would give it 3 out of 5 stars. 

I loved the cauliflower steak. It was placed on a bed of lentils in a curry of some sort and featured a green pesto sauce. The flavours on my dish were fantastic and I would give it a 5 out of 5. I liked it better than the cauliflower steak at the Keg, which I used to think was pretty great! My boyfriend tried it as well and he loved my dish as well.

Closer by my area, we actually stumbled upon Soco Kitchen and Bar which looked quite extravagant and seemed to be decently crowded. Spontaneously we decided to have dinner there.  

We were greeted by the staff and taken swiftly to our seats out on the patio, and for a nice summer night it was the perfect setting to enjoy the view of the Roger Centre, or the ACC (depending on what side of the table we sat on!).

The two of us started with some drinks - my friend ended up ordering a beer for himself, while I had a nice cocktail of Raspberry Twist (I believe it was called) on the recommendation of the waiter that night. It was definitely very refreshing for a night out in July!

Shortly after getting our drinks, our main courses came out, fresh from the soco kitchen! On the top portion of the photo we have my friend's selection - he ordered the Orrechiette Pasta which had smoked bacon, green peas, wild mushrooms, and truffle pecorino. On my side of the table I ordered a classic Beef Burger which consists of a ground prime chuck, smoked cheddar, bacon, red pepper jam, pickled onions, whisky BBQ sauce with a house brioche bun and a side of fries. My dish was honestly one of the best gourmet burgers I have ever had - and well worth the $19. The dining experience at Soco was also stellar, and promises a nice evening out with whomever you are spending it with. It is perfect for small get togethers and its location is definitely extraordinary as well!

The food, however, was awful. 
Appetizers:
- The mushroom flatbread (actually a pizza) was really good--though we could have just been super hungry.  
- Sweet potato fries, decent but soggy
Mains:
- Mushroom soup & the striploin...first, it took forever to come. The order was lost so I waited ages for it to come. Our waitress gave us a free dessert but I was so hungry I didnt even enjoy it. When I finally did get the soup it was cold. Again, I was hungry so I didnt even bother sending it back. The steak, medium well, was just okay.

That's what I would have said if the service was actually great :D 

The issue is, I see a lot of great reviews here so I expected the same. So my experience started with a very cold morning (In Toronto so duh!) and wanting a warm meal with my coffee. As we entered the restaurant we were greeted pretty aggressively with ""we only serve brunch now"". Naturally we're like ok fine, as long as there's coffee we should be golden. 

We were then seated and given a menu. The menu was nothing really special and a little pricey for what was in the area. This was our third restaurant and can say there are much cheaper options that were DELICIOUS. I digress, so then we wait, we talk, we wait. Then another couple gets seated exactly 24.75 inches (not accurate, it was just really damn close) away from us and within seconds (I kid you not) gets service. Welp that's when we took an executive decision to get our asses out of there. Wish our experience could have been better but it wasn't.

 From the moment we walked in, she already gave us attitude and told us we couldn't sit in the booths because it was reserved. But we were seated there by the server and we had made reservations. Instead of checking and politely asking us to move, she demanded us to leave the seats immediately. We ended up moving to another booth and table combined as we were a big group and the server nicely apologized for the confusion. 

We placed our order and the order was slow to come out and we never got cutlery, or plates at all. When we asked for another pitcher it took 20 mins to give us a new one as the manager stated that she doesn't take orders. When we did ask the server she had forgotten several times so we had to remind her and hence the delay. We ordered dessert and same thing happened, it was delayed. Their kitchen wasn't able to handle the amount of people in the restaurant as it was game night and probably the busiest they've ever been. 

Finally, when we asked for the bill, after we paid and tipped they came over telling us we paid the wrong one as they gave us the other tables bill. We waited for it to get refunded but they were busy running around, the paper ran out for the receipt and the manager came over. This time, not only did she not apologize for the mistake and the delay, she demanded that we do the refund and pay the new bill. It was a really small difference and it wasn't our fault that they gave us the wrong bill but she decided to a big deal out of it and gave us all attitude like we were at fault. It was horrible and we were not taking anymore of it so we just paid it and left. We didn't want to be there any longer to be further mistreated. 

On our way out, she was saying horrible thing about us to her employee and the worst part of it is that we weren't even out the door!!! Unbelievable. This is the worst customer service ever!!!

I will happily admit that we were a very large group, but we booked well in advance and the restaurant agreed to a fixed menu for us. The service from the wait staff was okay, for the most part. The problems we experienced came someone who I think is a manager, and one particular male waiter. 

Jack Astor's isn't really known for the quality of its food, but our problems began there. First, because we were offered a fixed menu, no changes in any way were permitted. For example, my vegetarian colleague was not permitted to have chicken removed from his chicken pasta, so he received dry boiled noodles instead. Another colleague requested his steak be cooked medium-well, instead of medium--this was also not permitted.

Recognizing that a large group like ours puts a strain on the kitchen, we could understand if we were asking for a different dish. But 30 seconds more on a steak? To achieve this, the manager told us, we would either have to hold back every plate for the entire group or have this colleague served last. Additionally, removing chicken from pasta is actually one less step, unless these are cooked in advance (which I would then recommend not eating). Beyond this, the manager who explained this to us was rude, condescending, and seemed annoyed by our business. As a result, my two colleagues chose not to eat. Good experience, right?

In terms of drink service, it was slow, inconsistent, and the male server who took some of our drink orders was, like his manager, rude and condescending. Truth be told, this was the least of our problems and was merely annoying, especially considering that gratuity was automatically added to our drink bills (watch out for this, business travellers).

And last but not least, on top of not being able to make even the slightest (and entirely possible) change to the temperature of our food, my ""medium"" steak arrived rare (and I mean *rare* with a capital R). I didn't dare send it back, because I didn't want to be party to yet another argument with the remarkably rude manager. 

I would not recommend this restaurant, plain and simple. This visit was disappointing and a waste of money, and will ensure that we do not book with any Jack Astor's again. All I can say to anyone who chooses to visit this restaurant is ""good luck.""",2019-07-11 23:03:51

It was in my check list, and what other occasion would do justice to a patio place like this than friendship day  
.
I will rate the service 4.5, that too on a busy Sunday. It's a must visit on summer afternoon to grab some brunch and play games with your people.
.
They have indoors which is equally amazing, at night it dazzles with the rope and small bulbs that they have put for ambiance. The night view actually dragged me to visit the place again 
.

Food I would rate 4.5/5, it was that lip smacking. Just deducted points as they don't have ranch available 

What we ordered:
1)fully loaded Chicken nachos, with sour cream, jack cheese, fresh avacado

2) ""Huevos Rancheros""
.I tried this first time in my life. And I almost fainted because it tasted heavenly. 
.
.
Fresh corn tortillas, with porched egg that was so perfectly cooked layered with black beans and salsa roja  accompanied by cheddar and jack cheese  
The egg mixed with gravy was giving and outstanding flavour. I am drilling right now 

4) hot wings
.
One can't go wrong with wings right? But this one will keep you smiling with every bite. Tangiest I ever tried

Pros:
-Vlad, one of the owners, is very nice and has accommodated me and my guests a few times even during busy UFC nights when there was no room 
-Laila, one of their head bartenders, is very friendly and efficient 
-their wings are Ontario farmed and tasty. I had interview with the vampire and my fiancé had their infamous Black Mamba, and he managed to get on their Wall of Flame for that one.. I don't know how he did it. 
-If you like spice, this is the place to go for your wings. Seriously. Scorpions Kiss and Black Mamba are outrageously spicy. Even my super experienced partner had his lips puffing up, and his eyes watering. He powered through and said they were delicious
-Occasionally good specials, on both food and drink-mostly weekdays though. Sometimes $5 pints and $4ish rail

Cons:
-some of the other servers have been slow-ish. I don't see them around very much anymore though. But it does generally take a while to get another drink 
-they close too early! Half the time I'm only leaving to get my beer at 11, and then last call is 11:45
-on the no-drink-special nights, beer can run a bit pricey. 
-if you want a dip, you gotta pay extra, and your wings only come with about 8 or so. 


Other noteworthy things:
-There is a jukebox, which i find slightly more expensive than the other jukeboxes of the same brand. It's about $1 per song. 
-There is a pool table, which is a nice change from the former shoeless joes, which just used the space for more tables 
-there is a patio for those nice weather drinks... if you can tolerate the sounds of cars screeching along Eglinton, swing by for a daytime pint. Otherwise wait until well after dinner. 
-there are 88 flavours of wings to try!! Including a few interesting seeming flavour combos. 
-if you eat those crazy ass black mamba 4 million scoville unit wings, DONT TOUCH YOUR PARTNER FOR LIKE THREE DAYS CAUSE IT WILL HURT

The service was a little challenging as getting the attention of the gentleman at the counter was tough in the crowd and there weren't many folks to take care of the patrons. Having said that, once we placed the order, it didn't take much time to get it.

I would tell anyone to avoid this restaurant at all costs. We walked in and on a day when Toronto is in an excessive heat warning and the AC wasn't working. That should've been our first clue. 

We tried to order quickly and after we put in our drink order I was told they didn't have Molson on draft. Molson (a Canadian) beer in a bar/restaurant was out?!?! Seriously! So I asked about another beer Richards Red (also a Molson product) - ""do you have this?"" Waitress replied yes, but then came back and told me they didn't have it. 

I stuck with water, quite frustrated that a bar/restaurant didn't have beer. After that mess my mother's drink she ordered took way longer than it should have. It was one of their ""signature"" cocktails, yet we could overhear the bartender (and apparently also a server and asst manager) talking her way through the instructions on how to make the drink. 

We then ordered our apps and meals together and waited...and waited...and waited...and waited. 

Then our meal and appetizers came out at the same time. We canceled the apps, since our meal was already there. Last issue was the salad my mother orders came without ranch dressing. No big deal until she waited for about 7 mins and still don't have her dressing. I had to get up and ask for it. Then when it came it was a tiny little helping for a huge salad. It was just embarrassing for the restaurant. 

I will never come here again! Bad deal all the way through and the fact they the staff seemed clueless about the whole ordeal made it worse.

Stopped by Wayne Gretzky's recently for lunch with a friend. We weren't anticipated a good meal, but wanted to grab a quick bite to eat before our eventful afternoon. I ordered the Oasis Chicken Club with a side of Caesar salad. I was surprised to find that the chicken was cooked perfectly and was very juicy, the sauce used was very flavourful, and the ingredients were fresh. The salad also came with a generous amount of bacon and had the perfect amount of dressing.
The service was excellent and the atmosphere was pretty great with lots of memorabilia, photos, hockey decor and TVs.
I wouldn't hesitate to return with friends to watch the game or for a quick lunch.",2019-01-15 23:55:16

The sticky toffee putty is probably their best dessert, but it's only for people that like desserts that are really sweet. The drinks are pretty good. The best one is the blood orange smash.

So my question is this: If your pool table is broken and you know your pool table is broken, instead of giving attitude that you need to come unlock it to release the balls every time, why not fix it? Or put an ""out of order"" sign on it? Sadly, the cute one with the old Maple Leafs logo was not usable, which is too bad.

The waitress was very nice as she let me mix my two go to wing flavours - honey garlic and garlic Parmesan so my wings were extra garlic-y but I thought the ribs were rather dry. 

This spot is a great one to watch a Raptors game if the space allows since they have one grand projector and a couple hinged TV's. I'll see myself here again if I ever happen to be at the mall.",2019-01-27 02:18:23

Since Jack Astor's had a nice patio, that seemed like the place to relax, eat, and try to cope with having had a very long day of travel. The hostess told me to sit wherever, so I grabbed one of the many free tables and waited. And waited. And eventually a waiter came by and told me that my actual waiter was coming, but could he get me something to drink. I'm pretty sure my actual waiter and my glass of water turned up together, at which point I ordered the fish and chips.

The fish and chips were...ok. I like shoestring fries and the coleslaw was decent. The fish seemed nice at first, but I eventually realized that there was way too much batter on it (some parts were just fried batter) and the inside part wasn't cooked all the way in some places. I ended up kind of picking through it and eating bits and pieces. Not the best version of that dish I've ever had.

The only high point of my experience was my waiter, who was absolutely delightful. I think we could have chatted happily all day. His only issue was that he actually was not a very good waiter.

I'd start with the fact that we went here because of how cool it looked from outside and even because my friends told me that you could get a big beer for 10$ which is a good price considering its location.
The menu is super limited, they don't have many options for vegans/vegetarians which is less than acceptable.
I'm not vegan but one of my friends is and even if he didn't want a burger he had to get it because it was the only thing who could be substituted with a plant based one.
Their menu looks identical to the Warehouse(where everything is 5$) except for the price.. BE READY TO SPEND MORE OR LESS 20$ for a small burger and a really tiny portion of fries. 
THIS PLACE IS OVERPRICED, 
NOT THAT CLEAN(check their washroom when they get busy), IT DOESN'T OFFER AN INCLUSIVE MENU AND THE SERVICE ISN'T THE BEST.

We came here on a Wednesday afternoon prior to a concert. At 5:30, it was not busy at all. We got a nice hightop window seat and were promptly looked after.

I ordered the mushroom burger - meaty, tasty.  The burger came with two nice beef patties, topped with brie, mushrooms and caramelized onions.  I opted out of the truffle alioli, but I'm sure that would have been really good too.

I got fries with the order, and to be fair, the fries were not the greatest.  It lacked flavour... it was dry. I'm not normally a ketchup person but I definitely needed to dip these guys in something. 

Their menu was extensive and it was a hard choice to make food wise.  A friend had the fried chicken sandwich.  It had a nice kick to it. Another had a cheeseburger, which she thoroughly enjoyed.

Since I considered myself a newly initiated expert on caesars, we couldn't resist ordering their intense loaded one. It came in a HUGE mug topped with a slice of pizza, a lobster tail, jalapeño havarti, bacon, celery, carrots, and pickles. It was out of this world delicious! 

Our bartender was great, and she offered suggestions when we couldn't decide on what to order. I went with the appetizer of loaded nachos. Holy cow they were huge, but delicious! I barely put a dent in them. My boyfriend got the Kellys Benny, two poached eggs atop an english muffin covered in bacon and hollandaise sauce. He said it was amazing.

I was greeted by a host named Carly, who promptly showed me to a clean booth with full condiments and brown paper covering the tables to give it its own vibe. My drink was brought straight over, and the girl serving me (Grace) was very accommodating and thorough when I told her of my allergy.

I chose the chicken fingers from their under $15 lunch menu, they came with fries and coleslaw (I opted out of the additional plum sauce due to my allergy) and they were perfectly seasoned.

The drink menu contained products made with Gretzky's own Niagara-based ""No.99"" brand cask whisky and ""Wayne Gretzky Estates Merlot"" which gives it that edge over bars competing with generic ingredients.

We came in around 5:30pm on a Friday and were immediately seated at a table in the front corner.  The interior to this place was pretty cool with the bar towards the front, somewhat close to where we were, with plenty more tables in the back and the walls were wooden and fashioned with stuffed animal heads with plenty of TVs playing sports.  At the start though, I wasn't very impressed with the service as our waiter came over and asked what drinks we wanted to start with, which we said water to start as we looked over the extensive beer list, but disappeared for almost 20 minutes and forget about our waters!  We saw him chatting it up with another table for a good 10 minutes while others were being seated around us and taken care, one of these tables he took care of.  He finally circled back around and he did apologize and brought our waters along with our beers right away.  He also expedited our order of poutine, so he made up for it.

So yes, we started off by splitting an order of the ""Fully Loaded Poutine.""  These were soo good!  The fries were thick cut and doused in gravy with more than enough cheese curds.  I really enjoyed that extra flavor from the bacon, scallions, and dollop of sour cream though!  This was listed under the ""Fresh Cut Fries by the Pound"" section on the menu and, no lie, this dish was a pound.  The family and I had walked around Toronto all day so we were pretty hungry, but on any normal night, I think this would've been a meal all on it's own.

As we devoured poutine, we each ordered a main dish, which came out to the table in about 15-20 minutes.  I thought was pretty fast seeing as how busy this place was getting.  I ended up ordering the ""Baja Fish Sandwich"" with a chopped Caesar salad as the side.  Now, this sandwich is listed on the menu under a section titled 'Big Ass Sandwiches' and let me tell you, this thing lived up to it!  I definitely needed two hands to eat this.  The sandwich itself was phenomenal!  I was so impressed by the ratio of beer batter to haddock: it was covered and cooked perfectly and the flavor of both batter and haddock was awesome!  The coleslaw, cilantro, and feta cheese added an awesome flavor, crunch, and kick to the sandwich and the guacamole on the bottom bun provided a bit of creaminess and balance.  Even the side Caesar was pretty good.  Now, I was able to finish the sandwich but in a surprise turn of events, I couldn't finish the Caesar as I was way too full, at the point where it was a little too full but I really enjoyed that sandwich.

Overall, we had a pretty good experience!  The beer selection and food were phenomenal but the service was a little iffy.  I admit our waiter made up for it and finished strong but first impressions are important...  Anyway, I would definitely stop here again.",2019-07-07 18:50:10

In a nutshell, the food at Jack Astor's near Yonge-Bloor was good but the service was slooow and not so great.

Stopping in for what was supposed to be a quick lunch on my way back to the office from the bank, I discovered some good food but surprisingly slow service.

Let's start with the food. I had a burger with fries and it was really good! It came with bacon and cheese and lots of thin cut crispy fries. The burger patty was juicy and tender and the whole burger was put together quite well. This was a good meal!

What kinda spoiled it for me though, was the speed of service. Ughhh! I was there for over an hour! And it really wasn't that busy!

Only three tables were occupied on the patio when I arrived and a gentleman took the table in front of me shortly after. That left about eight tables empty. The entire patio was shaded and cool and it was a lovely day. Was!

After around forty five minutes of waiting in the shade, the sun came around the building across the street and it was HOT! The food finally arrived and I just wanted to eat quickly and get out of there. It was getting HOTTER and I was now sweating buckets!

So now I was finished and waiting for my bill. Where were all the staff? The fellow at the table in front of me must have been feeling the same way because he got up to go and look for our server. He finally showed up (it must have been too hot for him out there), we paid and left.

But my adventurous tastebuds often lead me to change up the specifics of my order. Which is why I can say without a shadow of doubt their wings are better depending on which sauce you ask for. I usually get hot sauce and did this time, but last time I got Barbecue and I must say their wings pair best with hot sauce. Secondly was my drink I've been feeling for cocktails lately for some reason, so I got the Tropical trip and the only thing missing was the beach, because this drink tastes exactly like the drinks you will find on a tropical vacation.

What once was a sketchy looking Wild Wing is now a beautiful British-style Gastropub. Now that we've got that out of the way, let's get into the nitty-gritty.

The menu has lots on offer, which is something that I appreciated. Each and every single time, I have found myself at a loss for what to order because I kind of want everything. On this second visit, I had made a mistake thinking that we would be there during brunch, and it seems that brunch is only served on Sunday's. Weird flex, but okay. 

Both times I have had the French Onion Soup ($11) and have enjoyed the comforting and satisfying flavours. The serving size is also pretty forgiving, but you absolutely need to order a secondary item. On my most recent trip, I got the tuna tostada ($11) which when asking the server how big it was she described it to be a LOT smaller than what it actually was. I thought it likely could have used a bit more acid: the slaw was lacking in flavour, the lime slice they provide you to squeeze on was way too small. But otherwise, it was okay. Not the most mindblowing tostada I've had, but pretty legit.  One thing that was a bit disappointing was my pal's fries. On the menu, they are labeled as ""Duck Fat Fries"" but literally they tasted that regular fries that weren't that hot. 

The service here is pretty hit and miss. What I've noticed from visiting twice now is that both times there seemed to be one server for the entire restaurant. I visited at two contrasting hours (8 PM weeknight and 1:30 PM weekend) and the servers are literally doing their bests, for the amount of space they have to cover. 

Since my two visits here, I have suggested it to everyone I know. It's in a weird spot in Roncy/Dundas West but I'd love to see this spot not only thrive but survive.",2019-01-07 18:58:30

I originally made the reservation for 9 people and later called again to inform them that there were 10 people. The girl on the phone said no problem they will add that in. I also told the girl that this would be a surprise birthday and had asked them if they were able to accommodate and following along with my surprised plan. 

Since shark club was not a typical place for my boyfriend and I to go to, I had told him we were coming here for paint nite. The girl on the phone was happy to comply with my request and to my surprise when we got to the restaurant the hostess went along with it as well. 

But the positive comments stops here.

When we got to our table I can't help to notice how SMALL it was. It was just a bar table with people sitting on both sides. Also, luckily one of our friends couldn't make it, otherwise I wouldn't know where he could've sat down at. 

The food was a disappointment. I got the burger just to be safe and even that was sub par. The fries tasted like it has been sitting out. The burger was burnt. My friends ""truffle fries"" tasted exactly the same as my plain fries. 

Our server was nice but clearly not the brightest. We had a cake and when I asked her to bring the cake, her response was ""there's a cake?"" 
Even if she did not know or remembered, she could have went along with it and simply went to check without making her seem stupid. 
But that's not all.... 
Before the cake even got there, she came with a stack of plates and placed on our small tiny table (She might as well scream ""the cake is coming!"")
And well.. SHE DID. Cause after she placed the plates on the table she goes, who is the cake for ever so loudly when the birthday boy was sitting right beside me. Needless to say.. there was no surprise. 

I guess when 18% gratitude is included, you don't even have to try.

No big deal being that it was shortly after 5:00. 

They seemed a bit slow except for one large table and only a few other small tables. That's why I was a bit confused as to why service was so slow. We went without  drinks for extended periods of time. It took well over an hour to get our food. When we did get it, my opened faced, medium steak sandwich was literally dehydrated. You could even tell by looking at it. My son's steak was burnt. Completely burnt! The salads were decent and the fries were good but that's about all. 

As a side note, we are usually great tippers. Usually the minimum for us is 20%. I'm not even ashamed to admit we didn't tip at all. When the food it terrible and service is terrible and you spend $136+ dollars on a meal, it's pretty disappointing. Especially on vacation. I'm sure Toronto has many other choices to choose from and I'm sorry we wasted our time and money here. We must have gotten caught up in a tourist trap. 

Our hotel front desk recommended this place, which by listening to them, was our mistake. A wise traveler once told me that you should never follow a recommendation from the desk or concierge.

The place is beautiful but with a certain amount of masculine sterility, the attempt at BDE. The leather seats got uncomfortable and the height of the chairs at the low top are slightly too high to settle in for a date night.

Decent beer and cider selection. Kind of annoying to pay a premium not to drink beer but that's an ongoing gripe everywhere. 

Our server was lovely but definitely carrying one table too many.  
Now, the food is priced pretty fairly but, the kitchen is poorly run/short staffed. We waited forever for our food.  I found that the portion sizes were also a little skimpy. 

The tuna tostada was delicious but basically just avocado and slaw. For that it was $11. 

The burger was adequate, patty was a bit thin and my dining companion had to load their burger with the aioli from the fries in order to make it more tasty. 

I'm also going to go on record and beg restaurants to stop with truffle fries. They are disgusting. You ruin delicious food by dousing them in truffle oil. Just stahp it! 

I was still hungry so I ordered a chicken taco, as I mentioned the kitchen was extremely slow. Our server came over to address this. By this point I no longer wanted my taco but as it was ""two minutes from being done"" I said sure I'll take it.  If you're going to overload a corn tortilla with salsa and other ingredients that completely saturate it's shell, the least you can do is double up the shell. Or reconfigure it so you can eat it without a knife and fork.

Having been here for dinner and brunch, I think the food is decent but found it overly complicated. I'd like to see simpler offerings with high quality ingredients assembled in balance. I think the creative options are well thought out. I just found the food to be over-salted (brunch) or, as in the case of the jerk ribs I had (dinner) under-marinated (meat with jerk sauce on top). Portions are great and I hope they get the gourmet gastropub foundation right.

Service is mixed for me. Dinner mains were fast but dessert took way to long. Brunch was excessively slow (they open at 11 and we arrived at 11:20, before they got too busy). Super friendly and responsive wait staff. I just think they need to get the rhythm right. Having worked in this business it may be a matter of synchronizing the kitchen with the service and rotating table seatings in balance. Not sure what it is but something is off and I can't blame the wait staff if it's the same pattern on different meals with different servers.

I opted to leave this review because, if any of it resonates with The Commoner then perhaps it can improve. I think this place has bright a great vibe to our community and stands to bring a regular crowd together for local events and televised sports. And if my views are off then no big deal: it's a decent place that's walking distance and I still plan to drop in for the odd meal.

That said, loud restaurants aren't that unique in Toronto so I'm not influencing my review around it.

As for what does matter, let's start with #1 reason to come here - the food...
I had a very tasty ""Commoner Burger"" that comes with provolone cheese and bacon jam. 
I was admittedly skeptical of the $6 chicken taco, but it was a good size  and pretty darn good as well, with lots of white meat chicken breast sliced up within. 
The fish and chips were decent but 1 piece was mostly batter and the fries with both meals were a bit soggy and limp.

The craft beer selection is quality, with a nice mix of all styles and some of Ontario's best breweries. Kudos to the place for putting together a nice variety to choose from. 

Also, bonus points for the fact they take reservations, and the service levels were all perfectly fine, so overall it was a solid 4 star experience.",2019-03-07 21:55:39

I didn't even have to look at the menu to know I wanted to stop in. It's called The Gym! I can honestly say I went to The Gym on Friday evening!

Unfortunately, the good times ended there.

Well, okay, that's not exactly fair. The service was friendly and the beer was cold. But the food... Yikes.

I was in the mood for something unhealthy and cheesy, so I figured I'd get a foolproof item: Chili Cheese Fries (""Gym fries, layered nacho style with chili & melted cheese topped with a dollop of sour cream"").

The dish arrived a short time later and I was immediately concerned. Hovering around the edges were large swaths of completely unmelted cheese, which is obviously a complete no-no with a dish of this sort.

It only got worse from there, though. The plate of food arrived to the table long after it had been prepared, so it wasn't hot. Heck, it was barely warm. I'm not one to complain or send food back, but good golly was I ever tempted to in this case.

The chili was dry and flavorless, but again, it would've been fine if it had been hot. The cheese that was under the chili was okay, I guess, but there was absolutely no meltiness to be had. The whole thing was one big clump, basically. It's too bad, really, because the fries tasted like they had some potential. 

And that ""dollop of sour cream""? Non existent. Our waiter actually noticed this a few minutes after I started eating and asked if I wanted some sour cream brought out. Too little too late, my man.

I honestly don't understand how a joint sends out a dish this terrible. It just shows an absolutely disdain for the customer and frankly it makes me genuinely upset. I'm coming to your establishment to spend my hard-earned money and *this* is how you treat me? Ridiculous.

Drink wise I had a sombersby sangria, a Bellini and a pink lemonade. The sombersby sangria consisted of sombersby cider, absolute peach, lemonade, watermelon and orange. The drink itself was very smooth and light tasting. The Bellini was absolutely delicious! I wasnt thrilled it was so small but it went down easily so I'm not suprised. It was full of flavour a must have if you enjoy bellinis. The pink lemonade was my least favorite of the three. It tasted a bit like lemonade but had a stronger alcohol taste then the others. 
Food wise I had some wings and the queso and bacon dip. The wings were on the small side but they had several of them which made up for it. The flavor was good as was the quality of the chicken wing. Not the best I've had but good enough to get again. The queso and bacon dip was delicious! It has just the right about of smoky bacon taste to be noticable without being over powering and it came with a generous helping of chips. Great bang for your buck at $10.

To begin, the venue is made to look nice and put together but they are slacking in cleanliness. There was a dirty napkin under my seat and my hostess brushed off crumbs from my chair before pulling it out for me. I was a little grossed out. 

Wait time for food was longer than i expected but it's okay i made good conversation with my boyfriend in the meantime.

Then the food made me a little sad because you could see just how overpriced it is. I ordered the bombay butter chicken which i've had in the past at a different location, i understand that it will taste different from different chefs but i was underwhelmed. The food was good to eat but the portion was way smaller, I can go to my favourite asian restaurant and order a similar dish for the same great taste, for twice the portion but a fraction of the price. 

My boyfriend had the hand-pressed burger and that was pretty good, I had a bite with some fries and they were well enjoyable. However i find myself comparing it to a five guys burger that is just as good and also a fraction of the price. 

We also had the molten lava cake, which is my favourite and only real reason for coming here. I think this is most worth it if you ever come to joey's.

Tried the platter of wings which allowed up to 3 different flavor choices and came with fries, and veggies. This fed 4 adults, it was a good amount. We chose the homemade jerk, honey garlic and Thai chili. We all really enjoyed the homemade fries that tasted fresh and reminded us of swiss chalets original fries. I did not like the homemade jerk flavor as it didn't quite resemble jerk and it was quite sour, can never go wrong with honey garlic and the their chili was average, needs more pop of flavor.

I've heard a lot of good things about this place but I was a little concerned about the limited menu. I ordered the Raspberry Lemonade, which was just okkkk. It was essentially Sourpuss layered with ice and lemonade. There weren't too many cocktail options, but there was the standard Beer & Wine List with maybe a few interesting cocktails. 

When it came to food, I was really disappointed in the selection and quality of food. I split two apps with 2 friends and we were all pretty disappointed in what we got. 

We ordered the Spinach & Artichoke Dip & The Vegetarian Nachos Platter . The Spinach & Artichoke Dip tasted so much like broccoli that is was difficult to find any spinach or artichoke taste in it at all. The Vegetarian Nachos was simply a platter of tortilla chips drenched in half melted cheese with franks hot sauce on top. There wasn't a single vegetable like onions or tomatoes as a topping.  It did come with a little side tray of sour creme, pico de gallo and guacamole, and sadly those were the best part of the meal.

The smoked brisket sandwich was awful.  Why bother smoking meat when you smother it in a heavy oily dark fat sauce.   Could not taste anything but fat.  Why not in a slightly covered BBQ sauce?  The horseradish sauce made the sandwich better but it looked like thick mayonnaise and no one told me what it was until later.  The coleslaw needed to rest longer.  Not a lot of flavour.   French fries were pretty good.  

Was told the ribs were good.  Not too saucy.  BBQ sauce was on the side but no choices of spice level.  Ribs were fall off the bone but not enough smoke flavour in the meat.  

Coffee was as bad as the waitress said it would be.  Probably the worst in Toronto.  But I needed something to wash off my tongue because of the fatty sandwich.

The place is quite large, and offers happy hour specials.  My two friends and I had wandered around Toronto for a little while and decided to get drinks and catch up getting out of the chilly Northern air.

We were still in time for happy hour, so we ordered drink specials (Sangria, white wine, etc).  And we decided to get a few apps as well.  Seated upstairs at a high table, we didn't have to wait.  The stools were tall and wide and very comfortable. Our server was pleasant and attentive, but not too much. 

The ambiance was nice, and upstairs was a little more intimate in my opinion than down stairs.  Noise level wasn't too much of a problem, I felt I could hear my friends easily, despite how crowded it got by the time we left.  

The big joke here, is how far it is to get to the restrooms.  Even the establishment itself has funny signage on the walls as you make your way down to the third basement (or something equivalent).  And from sitting upstairs to the location of the basement, it is quiet a journey.  No lie.

I can't say that there was anything particularly stellar about JOEY, but it is a place with decent drinks and food that will satisfy.
One thing I didn't particularly like was the whole big brother creeper feel I got afterwards.  A day or two later I got an email from JOEY asking about my experience.  I may have checked in on Yelp, but I've never had an email like this before.  And I paid in cash so it wasn't like I had given them my information.

Customize every single topping, would prefer if this can be done on a sheet of paper. The server would need to wait as we thought about each topping and sauce.

A bit pricey for what you get, similar pricing to McDonalds and you could argue their food is just as good if not better. McDonalds is almost certainly faster.

And if you want to order 2 pounds and want 2 different flavours, they will  charge you the rate of 1 pound twice, instead of giving you the 2 pound price with a sauce fee. 

We ended up ordering 3 pounds of wings (which come with a max of 2 flavours), and there were 18 wings. They came with fries (decent, nothing special) and a few carrots/celery on the side.
When we ordered an additional pound, it came with 7 wings and fries, which makes me wonder why they are cheaping out on the volume orders that only had 6 per pound.

They have a lot of sauce options to choose from, but the spice levels are very tame .The ""medium"" maple barbecue flavour was very mild and even one of the hotter options (hot & dill) was lacking in spice.

There are lots of tvs, and once the Raptors game came on they did turn the sound on, so it has that going for it.

In the end, $65 after tax and tip got 4 pounds of wings and 1 beer which leaves me hard pressed to give more than 3 stars.",2019-02-25 15:44:40

We arrived shortly after 5:30 pm at which time it was fairly barren inside the venue despite it being Fri. and a great day weather-wise.  By about 6 pm considerably more people had arrived and it was packed by the time we left around 6:30.  Despite the increasingly crowded conditions, we had pretty prompt service (we were seated at a booth by the window) and our server was quite friendly too.  The venue not surprisingly has a pretty strong Irish theme in their colour scheme/décor and there is a separate darts room, pool tables and other games in a raised section and big screen TVs for watching sports and news, etc. throughout.

As the venue is pretty close to where I work I'll doubtless be making a return visit(s) to indulge in their really great Guinness deal.  Neither my friend nor I ordered anything to eat during our visit but we did check their menu fairly thoroughly and they offer a broad range of typical pub food.  My friend and I noted that as is increasingly typical of restaurants/bars, they have somewhat higher food prices to pay for their drinks deals, but being in a central Downtown location is also a factor in their food prices.  If you like Guinness (a very healthy beer) I recommend stopping by when their deal for this beer is offered if you're in the area.",2019-07-06 14:10:42

We had seats in a booth by the window in their separate glass enclosed sun-ish room. Really nice digs all around. The place is modern yet still retains a roomy feel (getting rarer downtown) and does not take on that cold aesthetic that some modern places do. 

Service was prompt, accurate and helpful. They did take my allergies seriously and that was very appreciated. From a staff perspective, the people seemed to actually enjoy working there which is always great to see. 

For lunch my friend had a salad with chicken and really liked it. It did look fairly nice. I did not try it as we are not that close. Lol. As for me, I had one of the best sandwiches I have had in a long time. It was a tuna club sandwich and I adorned the plate with delicious fries. 

The sandwich had just the right amount of varying texture, perfect amount of sauce and flavours that worked perfectly together. Oh and the bun squished just the right amount to help make eating it both enjoyable and delicious.

I love the vibe here, the lights were dimmed and we were seated at a nice booth near the kitchen, however it wasn't too loud like most tables near the kitchen are. 

*For appetizers, we ordered:

House Salad - $9. This was decent, it was a little small for the price and could've used more salad dressing as it was a bit dry but it was still something nice to munch on as a starter.

Mushroom Soup - $9. My boyfriend said this soup was very good. It was rich and creamy and had chunks of mushrooms. 

Calamari Fritti $16.25. THIS WAS AMAZING! The calamari was so meaty, there wasn't too much batter, and they even gave a few stalks of deep fried asparagus which was really yummy too. 

*For main courses, we ordered:

Herb Crush Salmon - $30.25. This was very good. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and came with lemon butter sauce, crispy mashed potatoes and asparagus. Joey's crispy mashed potatoes may be the best mashed potatoes I've ever tried, and my new favourite. I highly recommend this dish. 

Rotisserie Chicken + BBQ Ribs - $32.25. My boyfriend said this dish was very good as well. The chicken and ribs were meaty and saucy. It also comes with asparagus, and he substituted the fries for crispy mashed potatoes. 

The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the washrooms were disgusting. They don't have separate washrooms for men and women, they only have 3-4 individual washrooms that are shared by everyone.

The restaurant staff were extremely friendly (especially Alex, who was our server) and personable. We felt very welcome, and the food was delicious. Other reviewers have said it, but there is a little something for everybody on the menu. My husband and I both had the tuna poke bowl when we were there, and we loved it. My grandma had the butter chicken option, which was apparently very spicy -- and just up her alley. Good drinks. Tasty food. Wonderful service. We will definitely be back to eat.

Next, and most importantly, our wedding reception. We (and all our guests) had an absolutely spectacular time at the private dining area downstairs. I booked our event about 6 months out, and Hailey (both of them) was so helpful and thorough in explaining how everything would work. She answered my million questions over email and made me feel totally comfortable -- especially given the fact I was initially booking from out of town and had never actually been to JOEY Eaton Centre before.

We felt like we were in excellent hands, and that stayed true for the duration of our wedding reception. Guests were greeted by the super friendly private dining staff -- who's names are blanking on me, but every single person I came into contact with that night was so awesome. We wanted a low-key, relaxed, mix and mingle type cocktail reception, and that's what we got.

And the food. THE FOOD. The cocktail reception menu was why we chose JOEY in the first place, and it did not disappoint. Guests were raving about the sushi, and my husband and I were especially in love with the tuna tacos. So sad those aren't an option on the actual restaurant's menu, because we would be there weekly.

The atmosphere was great all night long. We were even accommodated an extra hour after our end-time because most of the guests weren't ready to call it a night. The pricing was reasonable. The staff were amazing. We couldn't have asked for a better night.

On a personal note, everyone there was very accommodating for my post-concussion issues. I was given a little storage room away from the event to rest in when I needed it. Music was kept low and mellow. All our instructions for what my health needed were followed and then some.

All in all, a fabulous experience. We're so grateful to all the staff at JOEY Eaton Centre for making our reception a memorable and fun night.",2019-06-12 20:41:58

Food in general is pretty good. Wings, however are excellent. The way they make it so that meat is juicy and the batter is soft and crunchy was quite delectable.

I had called several times prior, first calling to make a reservation where I was advised that I should be calling six weeks prior to reserve a lane. Then I called back and learned that no I could reserve a lane. At that point the girl on the phone told me as long as I come in about 45 minutes prior I will get my lane in time for my team.

I came in that day specifically about 50 minutes prior to the time I wanted to start bowling. I let the girl know, she wrote my name down and my cell number. I went out of my way to walk to the location and then walk back to where I was picking up the rest of my team. Once we arrived a different girl told us that no we would not be able to bowl as it was full at 6 pm. I was upset at this point as I had been told so many different things by different people, given wrong info so many times. The servers and hosts were not empathetic at all.

We went upstairs for some drinks and snacks, 6 pm arrives and I send my husband downstairs to check around 620, there were many open lanes. When I come down - the girl had crossed out our name. And I asked if we could bowl at that time and she flippantly replied oh ya I was coming to get you guys.

We start bowling and it takes us about 1 hour and 45 minutes to get through the game. The lane kept breaking down where we had to stop. In fact we were not even able to finish our game. The staff was very unprofessional - we had to flag down our server to get snacks halfway through the game. And there were times where they fixed the lane and never let us know that it was repaired and we would be able to bowl again. Keep in mind we had spent a large amount of money within the establishment and it seemed as though no one cared when we had all of these occurances that disrupted our night

I couldn't wait anymore, and went to cancel it in the app. I was not at all compensated for this time.

My second order, the next day, did not get delivered at all either. I waited over an hour and half, and I contacted Joeys. They contacted DoorDash. Joeys told me that my order was getting picked up in 10 more minutes. It was picked up soon after. But the driver drove off to the opposite side of town, and half an hour later started driving towards my apartment. I thought I would get it soon. The driver arrived near my apartment on the map in my app, and then completed the order without delivering it to me. So I was out of food again. Thankfully, I received a refund again at least.

Joeys apologized. I gave them one last chance. I ordered again. I got my order an hour later that evening. I received my rotisserie chicken. I just order this one dish, and it was overcooked. The chicken was just very dry, chewy, and stringy. I suspect that the chicken was reheated.

She comes back and says they dont have that size but they will make an order and let me know when it arrives. So I write down my name and number, pay my bill and leave. A couple weeks go by and I didn't receive a call or anything so I assumed they have the shirt but forgot to call. I walk in and told the bartender I'm hear for my shirt.

We ordered fries (with a side of gravy), jalapeño poppers and mozzarella sticks. For drinks he got a beer and I got a sex on the beach (1oz finlandia vodka, 1 oz mcguinness peach schnapps, with cranberry & orange juice). The fries were delicious, the gravy was slightly salty but hearty and paired well with the fries. The mozzarella sticks were decent. Not amazing but not bad either. The cheese inside had a decent pull at the beginning but not as much as they cooled down. The jalapeño poppers were pretty good. They do specific that there is only 5 pieces, great deal during happy hour. I also got a blue Hawaiian drink (3/4ox Malibu coconut rum, 3/4oz  mcguiness blue curaçao topped with pineapple juice and a splash of lime. When i got the drink the lime was at the top, but once it was stirred a bit it was delicious! Tasted like something you would drink on a beach or by a pool. With the second round of drinks we also ordered a margarita pizza. Pizza was pretty decent, if your last oking for gourmet this Isn't it but it's pretty good for bar pizza and you can't complain about the $12 price point. Most of the cocktails are $7 the same price as a beer which is awesome! What i liked about the cocktails is they allow you to upgrade to premium or top shelf liquor for $1-2 more, which is great if you are more particular about your alcohol. 

Our server, was friendly and knowledgeable. Very attentive and quick and accommodating with any dietary requests or changes. 

The washrooms are gendered and located in the basement which means temperature wise it's a little cold. The woman's washroom had 3 stalls and was fully stocked and clean. Automatic toilets, sinks, soaps, hand sanitizer and hand dryers. You can continue to hear (but not watch what's on tv, in this case a leafs game while in the washroom).

The overall sports bar is just that, a sports bar. A ton of tvs. We sat near the bar and could easily see 9 TVs not including 4 additional projection screens. The sound system is plugged into the TVs so it's a great place to watch sports. After happy hour they have a DJ that plays music sets between sports periods. The music is catchy, a good blend and not too loud. You can hear it clearly but you don't have to yell across the table to talk to who your with.

First off, the service was very good.  This review is for the food.

We ordered mozzarella sticks and fried pickles.  They were both good and the tomato sauce served with the mozzarella sticks had a nice heat on the end of it.  That is where the good part ends.

The wing menu was overwhelming.  There must have been over 200 different kind of wings on the list.  With that many options I was looking for a sampler, but there wasn't one.  A customer had to order wings by the pound and was only allowed more than one flavor if they ordered 5 pounds!  That wasn't happening...so onto something else with the menu.

I settled on a grilled cheese that had pulled pork, brie, bacon and caramelised onion.  This should have been so good but fell so short.  The onion was in huge chunks, the bacon was fatty and not crunchy, the pulled pork as bland.  It was such a disappointment.  My significant other had fish and chips.  I have to admit that I raised my eyebrows when he placed his ordered for that in a place like this...but I couldn't stop him.  I think he regretted his decision when he asked for vinegar and was brought onion vinegar instead of malt.  Thankfully he isn't fussy and ate regardless.  When I asked him how it was, his response was ""it's food"".  My thoughts exactly.

I can't say that we will return or even recommend this place given that the fries were not seasoned...even with a sprinkle of salt.  But I think we knew we were not going to have a good meal upon arriving.  Shame on us.",2019-06-03 18:35:26

I eat my food and pay up without thinking. Walking out I notice that the bill was a bit high. I figured I might have accidentally clicked the default 25% tip prompt (bad sign there).


So the server tells that the $15 deal is only for Amsterdam beers. I bought a Stella.

Nobody told me this when I ordered, nor is it on the sign. I point this out.

Now, I'm not here getting bent up over $7. I wasn't planning on asking for a refund or anything, I already paid. Maybe a ""ahhh yeah my bad"" or something. Maybe I missed something?

Gord ordered a Classic burger (with no tomatoes) and onion rings rather than fries.  I had an onion ring and it was good.  Gord said it was a good burger and he'd get it again.  The bun was soft, just how I like them.

Stella was friendly and chatty and took good care of us.

Apparently there is a back patio too but with the front, we had no dog issues! The back patio may be licensed soon as well, hot tip. 

Tried the deep fried pickles and spinach dip and I was really impressed! The picked were perfect little coins, like chips, in a yummy ranch dip to cool it all down. The snack menu is not too big, but had all the favourites. 

I also came here once for a birthday party! The birthday girl was able to rent out the whole top floor and it was perfectly suited for everyone.

We were out for a walk on Canada day and were looking for a place with a patio to have a drink or too, as we walked down Roncy a glint of light caught my eye through the open doors of Round the Horn and I got a sense that this little bar had a garden patio in the back. We walked over to inspect and low and behold my guess was right!

A cozy little spots with tons of seating amifst big shady trees and a nice private fence. It felt like we were in someone's backyard having long weekend beers (which I guess we kinda were).

They had a great wine list but also ample beer selection in both conventional and craft varieties. We all got something we loved.

We were hungry shortly thereafter and were a bit surprised to see that despite pub staples like nachos and burgers their menu was dominated by... hot dogs! Hot dogs in every possible topping combination from german oktoberfest bratwust to coney island dogs and everything in between - and CHEAP!

I started with a fresh house made baked pretzel with mustard, wow!!! Incredible! Then went with two classic Coney Dogs (with cheese and chilli) and I felt like I was at a ballpark in America taking in a baseball game, I mean pretzels, hot dogs and beer - all for fair prices?!?! What is this place?

Our main complaint was the Greek fries because they were incredibly soggy, even the ones that had no sauce on them. They all had the texture of mashed potatoes which is pretty crazy since you'd expect a wing place to know how to properly fry a batch of fries.

We also got 2lbs of wings - one lb Thunder of God which I have no complaints about and another lb of Hail Caesar (garlic parm). Definitely not the best garlic parm wings we've had. Not sure if that's how people like them but they were drenched in sauce (assuming butter is the main ingredient of it) which made it feel like we were eating butter with a side of wings. 

The bill came to $50 for 2 lbs of wings, 2 drinks and an order of fries. Definitely pricey for the lackluster quality of food you get.

And indeed, I did order the Pulled Pork Poutine (""Aged cheddar, jalapeno-Monterey Jack, bread and butter pickles, crispy sweet onions and hand-crafted gravy"").

It arrived shortly after and it's a decent poutine. There were a few obvious problems, though. The main issue here was that the dish didn't arrive to the table hot. It had clearly been sitting around for a while, and so the whole thing was just slightly hotter than room temperature. It's not ideal.

I should also note that the concoction was very, very sweet. The pulled pork had clearly been prepared with a sugar-forward barbecue sauce, while the naturally-sweet bread and butter pickles only exacerbate this feeling. It almost felt like a dessert poutine.

The food however is, meh. Not horrible but nothing I would be quick to return for. If found the balsamic
on the appetizer flatbread to be far too sweet (but that may be just my person taste). The calamari was cooked well but were very, very small. They came with two standard dipping sauces (Thai chili, and a dill one).

My spinach salad was good. Not too much dressing. I did add a BBQ chicken breast. I anticipated it to be freshly cooked and warm but it was refrigerator cold and heavily coated in BBQ sauce. (Not sure it was actually barbecued). I would have preferred a plain portion of chicken as the BBQ sauce wasn't my favourite combined with the vinaigrette.

I had a mojito to drink. The menu says ""muddled to oder."" Let me tell you, this was nothing more than a prepared tinted green sugary ""mojito mix"" and some mint leaves thrown in. There was no muddling and this was not an authentic mojito. I did kind of expect a prepared beverage but gave them the benefit of the doubt based on the menu description.

The Game Area:
On the weekend the game area is really packed. It's so packed that it takes over an hour to get into the Rec Room and then you have to wait in huge lines to play random games. Don't even think about the basketball as you might have to wait an hour. The area is also really crowded that it might make you feel claustrophobic. 

I recently visited the rev room on a Sunday evening and it wasn't as busy. There were still lines to play each game but we did not have to wait an hour to load our game cards. 

The Stage:
Recently I discovered the Rec Room has a huge area in the back for private events. We came to the Rec Room to watch the magician illusionists and the back room is huge and so cute. They have European phone booths everywhere for photo opportunities and nice circular coaches surrounding coffee tables for large groups. It felt like a fancy lounge. I'd love to venture back to that room for more events. 

The Parking:
There is one lot close to the Rec Room and it costs about $30 to park for the evening. We were shocked. I'd definitely suggest the TTC or parking further away and enjoying a nice stroll to the Rec Room. 

The Restaurant:
The last time we tried to dine at the restaurant we waited the suggested hour and were then told it would be a few more hours. We were famished and went someplace else to eat. It's definitely difficult to get a table here over the weekend. 

The Bars:
The drinks are good but pretty basic. They don't have too many fancy cocktails. I ordered the coco loco drink, which featured coconut water, tequila and some other ingredients and I found it to be really strong. 

Snacks:
They provide guests with free popcorn. You just have to ask. Tonight it was really salty. I'd give it 2 out of 5 stars.

We also had to wait over 30 minutes for a table when clearly they had over half their restaurant empty I see no reason to have to make us wait and other people behind us wait, I had asked if the tables were reserved and was told no. I would recommend you either go somewhere else to eat or if it's the games go to Dave and Busters much better service and games. I would recommend the Square One Rec room if it's Rec Room you're looking for.",2019-08-14 16:19:24

For those that don't know, it's basically Cineplex's version of Dave & Busters, but more corporate, and nicer.

The Rec Room is always packed, and it doesn't help that they squish all the games into a really tight midway. Seriously, there's no way for you to walk through the midway without bumping a kid or two. 

The food is pricey, but decent. The complimentary Cineplex popcorn is a nice touch and always serves the role of an appetizer for me. Drinks aren't too bad either; in fact, my friend complained that our Rum and Cokes had 'too much' alcohol...usually, people complain that there's too much Coke!

The pizzas were so amazing! Perfectly cooked and thin with a very fluffy and soft crust. We ordered 3 pizzas between the 2 of us so we obviously had leftovers the next morning but I was so surprised that the pizza was not hard and stale the next day- the crust was still chewy and delicious. I posted photos but can't remember exactly which pizzas we ate (this visit was a few months ago) but I do remember that the special had sausage and potato but the potatoes were so delicious and different from any other potato pizza we've ever had- they were a little mashed up and tasted like buttery goodness.

The Rec Room has a very similar concept to Dave and Busters - an indoor arcade sort of place for all ages. I really like that they allow you to allow you to take your drinks with you while you play the games. 

We came here on a Saturday night and it was was packed! 
We were a group of 8 people, and found it fairly easy to find our way around. 

We spent about a good 3 hours here enjoying the games, drinks & each other's company. It was a nice change of pace from the usual dinner and drinks. 

Side Note: 
- Coat Check is FREE you just have to give you phone number and their software sends you a text with your coat check info.

 - Your wristband does NOT expire, if you don't end up using all your tokens, you can keep the wristband and come back another time. 

I only two things that bothered me here were at the front counter, when I asked the cashier to check my balance, she said she could not. She could only add to my balance. I understand that there is a credit check machine nearby, but it was super frustrating to stand in line to find out this information to only have to stand in line again after checking my balance. 

The only small detail was that I noticed a lot of these games are in very close quarters. When you're in a group, it's easy to get lost or it can become pretty cramped while you're waiting for a game. I understand that they have limited space for the game, so there's not too much they can do.",2019-03-20 18:50:59

I only had the pizza but I thought it was above the many pizzas you'd receive from an entertainment establishment - it had mozzarella cheese, arugula, sausage, and grilled bell peppers.

It was completely watered down. For the kids meal we ordered the chicken bites and a cookie for dessert. Both items had no seasoning and no flavor.

Came here last night with my friends, had high hopes of playing fun games, but a lot of the games were mediocre. I liked the fact that they got rid of the ""ticket"" system and everything is stored digitally in your wrist card - though you could lose it easily if you don't tie it tight enough...

My friends and i walked around the place and pretty much played with each game once. There's not much variety compared to Dave and Buster's or my childhood favourite ~pLaYdIuM~. A lot of the games were out of service when we went. Like the air hockey, some shooter games were glitchy and didn't allow us to move forward. The arcade area was really cramped, and it was hard to navigate through the crowds of drunk adults. 

Had a Daura Damm at the bar - which I'm so grateful for because of my gluten intolerance. Not a lot of places have options for gluten free/removed beers.

Right off the bat, they have a terrific location going for them being situated by Rogers Centre and inside the old Roundhouse. It's very nice inside and also massive. The layout effectively has three areas: 1) video games closest to the entrance 2) general dinning area in the centre 3) Big  screen with stadium seating at the back.

On video games alone, it might just be a '3'. There's still quite a good number of games, but it could be far better if they didn't have so many ones solely focused on winning tokens. I'm not even just talking about skeet ball (which is classic), but probably two dozen games that have little to do beyond luck and hoping to win a jackpot - basically glorified slot machines.

The event area in the back was quite impressive and the projector screen was massive. There are also seating areas off to the side a bit out of the action and not facing the main screen. Each table is paired with a fairly standard size screen. It would be fine depending on what someone was looking for, though that didn't seem to be clearly communicated to our group in advance as we thought we'd be facing the big screen.

I was really impressed by the food. That was in due part that I had low expectations, but all things equal, the food all seems to be prepared fresh and not ""fresh out of the freezer"". I even thought the value was pretty good considering it's location. IMO, they do better than a lot of the other chain restaurants in the downtown core and even some other stand-alone locations.

The rec room is part of the Cineplex company but elevated; it's fully licensed with plenty of arcade games to play.

We ordered one of the Belgian wheat ales, their skillet tortilla ""nachos"" and their pork belly baos.
The Belgian wheat ale was definitely lighter than shock top or Belgian moon, and had hints of chamomile. I always judge a good bar by the type of orange they provide with, and for Belgian wheat I expect an actual orange wedge. Unfortunately they don't provide orange wedges, only orange half-wheels. Lots of citrus flavours of notes which I enjoy, however lots of places including this one do not include the proper orange wedge which makes if fall short for drinks

The skillet ""nachos"" was interesting; Instead of tortilla chips they were actuall full-circled tortillas baked and layered with various cheese sauces and toppings. I ordered it with the pulled chicken, however be sure to ask for it dressed in a sauce like bbq otherwise it would just come dry. I didn't expect the nachos to be so small for the price, especially since Cineplex VIP cinemas nachos are comparatively the same price however the nachos come LOADED with toppings and cheese.

The ""baos"" were average but nothing special. It had the addition of pickles which isn't traditional and did not add to the dish, rather the pickling overpowered the steamed baos and the pork belly. The Bao itself was very thick and the ratio of meat-to-Bao was very off. Too much Bao, too little meat.

We went to this location for a friends birthday. We ordered some chicken parmigiana, salmon with jasmin rice and I got the holy smoke burger that I substituted with the veggie patties.

The vegetarian menus they have on the menu are fantastic options, I highly recommend you try those, rather than doing what I did. I also didn't like that they only give you the second patty for the veggie sandwich when you ask to jack up the burger. They said the veggie patties are heavier so they only give you one patty. 
The salmon was cooked to perfection, it was moist and flavourful. The pasta was also delicious, the bow ties are one of my favourite shapes. At the end of the meal we had the servers sing the birthday song, and they brought us a brownie with whipped cream and a sparkler.

Let's start with the ambience ... you can sit inside in a bar or on the street. You pick, but the lesser of two evils would suggest going across the street.  

Drinks are fine. The fishbowls are a cute idea if you are looking for a sugar high, drinking more than the bladder can handle and booze that you can't taste. The beer flights are a cool idea, too bad the beers taste like I brewed it in my bath tub. If you want water bring your own (keep reading I will explain later). 

Food is edible. The bowls have plenty of rice, not so much taste. The salad is a full bowl of lettuce but certainly not much more. Kids food is more like what is served at a military academy ... over cooked and flavorless. 

So why should you bring your own water you ask?? Service. Simply said, service. It is so easy to give good service, and they miss the mark consistently. Nothing is served together, it comes with out a smile and basically ""who got this"" as opposed to something more enticing. 

One positive. The chocolate cake comes with kettle corn. That was a nice treat ... hopefully they can build on that.

So I am sharing this as I live locally and have frequented this location many times - it is your basic pub/bar.  Great for watching sports and catching up with friends.  But...a family member of mine went to this bar, a wonderful and amazing woman in her mid-thirties...a professional health care worker...and someone that does not ever get in trouble...EVER!

She was not drunk. She was not talking to anyone.  She was having a drink and watching basketball and then was physically assaulted by a bouncer.  First, Dog and Bear I plead with you to respond to this as my friend, a young woman, was 1. Physically assaulted by one of your employees and 2. As a young woman you put her in danger throwing her out of the bar into a dark back ally.  This is such a shame while also completely disgusting...as I have frequented this place enough to know that there are all sort of drunks and loud guests...there are street people who harass you and you enter and exit the place, and I have never seen anyone asked to leave so that this happened to her is both terrifying and disgusting.

Reservation: the call in to reserve was simple and not Difficult, when we arrived I sent my friend in to check in for us while I parked. My friend told me the hostess didn't acknowledge her for close to 4 minutes and was rather rude, playing on her phone or iPad the whole time.

Service: we had a table of twelve that came in sporadically through the first 1/2 hour of our 2 hour reservation. Our sever was pretty slow and inconsistent with his timing for it not being to crazy busy. He seemed distracted and having a bad day so I can't say too much beyond that

Kitchen: our above mentioned 12 person reservation with staggered arrival made me realize how bad this kitchen is with their organization. I was the first at the venue and ordered a 6 layer tortilla thing, everyone else ordered when they arrived too ... I waited 45 minutes ... while everyone else received their food first ... it happens I guess but I did expect a better timing on a simple dish

Beverages were a great selection, a tad pricy but you have to expect that for the location and such

Now; to the food:

Good
- burgers looked and tasted amazing, cooked perfectly
- pizza was phenomenal, great topping layout and even sauce distribution 
- falafel was great, filling and very tasteful!

Bad
- Cesar salad was literally lettuce, croutons and a dollop of dressing. No flavour.
- the rainbow salad was expensive and lacked creativity and flavour .. it was just an over priced veggie tray basically 
- 6 layer tortilla appetizer seemed like it was a combat back from old El Paso that you can buy for you house for 2.99 at metro. It was bland and soggy

One of my friends decided to host a little get together at the Rec Room for the Superbowl so it was my first time and the place is really kind of cool.  It reminds me sort of a Dave and Busters and for the downtown core, this place has an absolutely huge footprint.  While there's multiple dining areas, a large dedicated game watching area and an arcade with a tickets rewards system it very well is like a grown up version of Chuck E Cheese.

The games are accessed via wristbands which are loaded near the main entrance with a variety of pricing for credits.  Games have different pricing so the Indy simulator takes something like 20 credits (equivalent to 5 bucks on the lowest plan) and some only take 5 or so.  Basically these coin up type games are all revenue connected via their pay system network so there's no actual money required at the games themselves, just the wristband swipe to deduct credits to play the games.  The games are quite contemporary as well.  Higher def screens, up to date games and the kind of games you won't see or play on a home console type system.  Other games of chance are the kind of games where an accumulation of tickets are traded for prizes at the redemption store.  Such prizes as Pops (the collectables), candy and other toys are available.

The food varies from sharable appetizers to sandwiches, pizzas and even entrees like steak etc.  The drink menu also has a variety of cocktails beyond just beer and wine.

The area we were seated in was an area near the back but to the side so we didn't have a view of the super large projection screen but we had our own little boardroom type table with a large screen.  The back side room had about 6 of these set ups.

The food was good.  I had ordered the 310 burger which was a double burger and I added cheese and bacon.  The fries were fresh cut.  I liked the food but it wasn't cheap but it certainly wasn't poor quality.  A 60oz pitcher of Goose Island was 26 which wasn't outrageously priced.

I had a good time at the Rec Room and it's certainly a great place to have a get together especially it if involves game night for any sport.  Being that it was the Superbowl the place seemed to have Budweiser sponsoring the evening and they offered many free prizes and other promotional NFL items.",2019-02-04 18:53:52

I would recommend the drink if you like fruit drinks that don't have the harsh alcohol taste to it. 

I thought the games were fun! There were a lot of options to choose from. Me and my boyfriend also went there on the civics holiday so the fact that they were open was a plus. They also had a deal of 170 credits including the game bands for $25 where they also allowed us to use the student discount on top of that.

I'm not sure how much violence erupts over Pac Man or air hockey, so my first impression was ""This place takes itself way too seriously.""

You basically have to grab her to get her attention, which might be what the men-in-black-suits-and-red-ties are for. Other waiters/waitresses won't take your order. Only the one who's ignoring you will take your order. A few of us complained at our table, but the response was ""Yeah, sorry about that. It's busy right now.""

It was a warm night, and we were lucky to find a table by the large window that opens onto the sidewalk.  If that were not available, we would have found the place far too noisy.  (Maybe that's a reflection of our age -- 69 and 71 -- but the noise inside the restaurant when we arrived around 7:30 pm was so loud that we could not hear each other.

Service throughout the evening was agonizingly slow -- and the place was not even full.  Our drink order was taken fairly quickly -- and then seemed to have been forgotten.   We sat another 10-15 minutes before the drinks arrived.  We then placed our orders.  We started with edamame, which was excellent, and arrived in reasonable time.   Then the real waiting began.

It took ages for our main courses to arrive.  We were pretty sure they'd forgotten about us.  My wife had the curried noodle bowl (forgot the name -- maybe Panang?) and I had the fish and chips.   The wait was ridiculously, and frustratingly, long.  When the food finally arrived, our server apologized for the long delay and said the kitchen was overwhelmed with take-out orders.   One would think that the customers sitting at tables might have some kind of priority --  but not so.   A young woman who was presumably the manager on duty also came over to us to apologize for the wait (which was the right thing to do), and said she'd be back to check on us and see how everything was.   She never returned.  I did not request any special treatment, but I have to say that most restaurants would do something to compensate for a bad experience -- such as making the drinks complimentary.   Not here.

The good news:  my wife did like the noodle bowl.   Unfortunately, no such luck for the fish and chips.  The fish itself was devoid of any taste, and the batter was also almost tasteless.  Tried adding lots of lemon but it didn't help.

Finally, we finished, and waited for our bill.  This also took a very long time, despite the fact that I kept scanning the restaurant for any sign of our server.   Finally got it, paid up, and left.

Restaurant, Arcade and Lounge all in 1
Free coat check

Cons:
Jack of all trades, but not great at any one thing
No private parking

The Rec Room is a great idea in theory.  A restaurant, arcade and lounge all rolled up into one location.  They do a decent job of it, but nothing truly excels to make you consider it over other businesses in either field.

We were invited by a family friend to celebrate a birthday at the Rec Room.  I've heard of the place and what it offered but never really had a chance to go until now.   

The Rec Room is located just across the Skydome (It will always be Skydome to me).  As such they don't have their own parking, which is sort of understandable considering it is downtown.  However, because of it's proximity to Skydome and Scotiabank arena, if there is a sporting event happening during the time you're there, expect the parking lots to jack up their prices a little/a lot.  The Leafs were playing the day we were there in the evening.  Luckily our party was for the afternoon.  The parking lot we chose was $12 until 6pm.  When we were leaving the prices were jacked up to $30 for the leaf game. Something to be aware of.

As I mentioned before, the Rec Room consist of 2 restaurants, an arcade and a lounge.  Our party was in the restaurant and arcade sections for the most part.

- The restaurant:
The food for the most part was decent.  Expect to spend about $30 on food alone.  There's a kids menu at $12 which was probably the best value if you ask me.  The food gets the job done is the best way I can put it.  My wife got the salmon and as you can see from the pics, it's on the smaller side.

- The arcade:
I'm a gamer so the arcade part was the main attraction for me.  The arcade runs like a Playdium or Dave and Busters.  You purchase tokens on a card or wristband and you play the games using those tokens.  In terms of game selection, I found it a bit lacking here as a gamer.  There were far too many reward games that literally last less than 30 seconds.  They had about 10 true arcade games here that you could play with a group of friends at the same time.  The reward games also cost a lot token wise.  One of the kids at the party burned through 200 tokens (About $30) in less than 10 minutes.  I've gotten a whole days worth of fun on $30 at Playdium and Dave and Busters.

The best part of the Rec Room is the staff.  They were all friendly and super helpful throughout our visit.  They have a free coat check which is super convenient because of the kids.  Our waitress was amazing.  She was serving 2 other large tables as well as ours and she was on the ball all day.  She made our visit.

The Rec Room is a jack of all trades but unfortunately doesn't excel at any one thing.  If you're in the downtown core, it's worth a try.  I would make the trip to Playdium or Dave & Busters.",2019-10-30 12:02:23

I really took a star off because when I was paying my food I am mistakenly skipped the step to tip the waitress and the waitress was really looking at my receipt and asked me if I like my food and I said yes and she was like oh well next time you should tip which I found really rude and uncalled for because I seriously was going to tip her if I was able to redo it but because of her attitude I didn't!

This is the adult version of Chuck-E-Cheese but you get all ages here. It's incredibly loud and so busy you can't even get to any game. 

I wouldn't recommend this place as most games are 6 credits (you buy credits and load them onto a card) and last no more than 10-25 seconds. There are no two or three tries and the money gets eaten up quick. 

You play games to win tokens to trade in for quite a terrible selection of prizes, many of which are for children. 

This place works for parents who have extra money to spend to sit at the bar while the kids play on the games.

Dipping Donuts - OKAY... This is not a carnival-level dessert. It is an incredibly savoury & sweet treat that has a slightly hard exterior with a very chewy&soft interior that mixes well with the 3 different dips. Definitely a must!

Then later we realized that the other cup was dirty too with dry coffee stains down the side...again I asked the server to take it back only this time she sassed me about it and walked away as i was mid sentence...the girl didn't come back and we left.

I can only imagine she reacted this way as I had already paid in advance and tipped her.

Fast forward to when we arrive. We are told that there is no basketball section, this is a Leafs game only event, and basically to get out.

I LOVED the Cider Sangria that they had. It was so refreshing and the cider helped cut the taste of the wine and it was full of fruit!! 

Mozzarella Sticks - super cheesy, perfectly fried and great dipping sauce

Cauliflower Bites - perfectly coated and fried, not mushy at all, love that you can choose your own wing sauce as a topping. I only wish they had tossed all the bites in the sauce and not just sprinkled it on top because the ones on the bottom had no sauce at all

Jalapeño Poppers - didn't have jalapeño pepper in them, I think it was a red pepper, but they were still good

Garlic Sticks - these were our least favourite. It was more of a stick with a sprinkle of garlic than anything else. I wish it was seasoned better and tossed better because it really was just eating a stick of fried dough",2019-09-09 14:03:29

I had a Turkey burger with tater tots, which I thought was quite tasty. My colleague had a Double Decker burger with fries, about which he was also quite positive. He also had ice cream to finish while I had a coffee. We both felt the food quality was quite good and the service was excellent. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient, and the food came out quickly after our order. The prices were not bad for everything we had.

Yes, because the location of this St. Louis Bar & Grill is convenient for me. It's located near the Roger's centre and below a condo building. It was a Tuesday evening and surprisingly, they did have their half priced wings promotion. I overheard from a server talking to another customer that night that it had something to do with the Jay's season being over and that they don't have promotions during game days? The Leaf's season has started, so now, does that mean they'll revert back to regular pricing? I'd recommend calling beforehand as other reviews have said that they don't honor that promotion. 

Maybe, because food was actually quite tasty... when my order was correct. 

No, because the service and the servers were subpar. I understand the 40 minute wait time on a Tuesday evening at 6:30pm. What I don't understand if how they decided which party would sit at which table. This location had booths, tables with chairs, high tables with stools, tables that could separate to sit parties of 2 and tables that couldn't separate and seated four. While waiting, I saw parties of two assigned tables that seated four. To me, it makes more sense to seat parties of 4 at tables of 4 and seat parties of 2 at tables that can separate into two. 

After being seated (we were a party of 2), we knew what we wanted to order but we didn't get to speak to our server until another 15-20 minutes after she took the order of another party (who were seated after us!). When our wings came (we each ordered 2lbs), one of my flavours wasn't what I ordered. Our server apologized and came back with the right order, but it just tasted like they put the new sauce on top of the incorrect order. 

Hmmm. I'm torn. Would I come back? It's a maybe for me. And it would only be on a Tuesday when they have half priced wings. And after 8:30pm.",2019-10-26 15:02:56

I had forgotten about Lucky Clover until I stumbled upon it while walking back to my condo on Friday morning. It was hot. And I was starving.

It was 11:20 am and the restaurant was empty. I think that should have been a sign. There was no one to greet me at the front entrance. I waited a few minutes before a friendly waitress came to seat me.

Service was just okay at first. But as the meal progressed I didn't see the waitress again until I had long cleared my plate. I also had to remind her about ketchup for the potatoes. Which were disappointingly bland. How do you screw up potatoes fries?

I ordered the Eggs Benedict with sausage and bacon. Now - if you look at the picture I upload, can you tell if it has sausage or bacon? Nope, me neither. And that definitely was not hollandaise sauce on top.

This would be my last meal in Toronto and it was extremely disappointing. I should have stuck with the salad bar at Longo's - because their food was simply amazing.

Poutine tots were the best part of the meal. 

Veggies on the burger were fresh and really well cut and perfect amount applied.  

I was really looking forward to the ""homemade pickles"" but I have to say they underwhelmed and would rather fresh cut fresh pickles and you will have a winner. 

Well I've been here and done that and hope you can avoid the same reality.

We split an Our burger the day before as a snack, and was pretty impressed. It wasn't as greasy as burgers can be in the states. I wasn't sure if I'd like the sauce, but it was really tasty. So we decide to try it today, big mistake....

We sit down, and were pretty much ignored and didn't get our drink order taken right away. And when I got my drink, the soda was flat! I got something else, that was flat too. It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks. 

Then, when the food came, the server (not our original server) almost gave our order away to another table!  I panicked and made sure we got it. Food was good( got my own Our burger this time with fries). Poutine tots were good, BUT fell apart fast. I also noticed a table behind us waited 40 minutes (!!!!), and had to leave without getting their food because they were late for a show.

It just seemed really disorganized, chaotic and not very well run. 

Our whole trip to this beautiful city, I made some great calls on our food choices... but unfortunately for this place I struck out. Food tasted good but you guys need to step up your service and being prompt. Especially on weekends, when there is a sporting event. Anything but fast isn't acceptable.",2019-07-06 22:16:17

There were two pieces of tiny fish...probably the same size as frozen fish sticks you find in the grocery store. The fries were soggy and a very small portion. The kitchen had also forgotten to give us tartar sauce...a necessity for fish and chips. How do you forget tartar sauce for a fish and chips dish? The cold slaw was stale and you can see from the color that it has been sitting in the little cup for a while already (prepped ahead of time). 

The seafood linguine was much better than the fish and chips. $22 with chunks of salmon, mussels, calamari, and big pieces of shrimp.

We showed up around 6:00 on a recent weekday armed with a reservation, and were quickly shown to a cozy table near the back. (It might've been a little too cozy, as we were seated mere inches away from other diners.)

I quickly settled on the Crispy Chicken Sandwich (""brioche sesame seed bun, southern fried chicken breast, kale & swiss chard slaw, tomato, baby swiss cheese, mayonnaise"") as my entree, and I asked for onion rings as my side.

It was apparent right from the first bite that I was in trouble. The most obvious problem here is the sogginess of the sandwich, which, given the word ""crispy"" in the name of the concoction, was especially off-putting. There was absolutely no crunch to be had here, and that was what I was in the mood for (and wouldn't you be if you'd ordered a ""southern fried"" chicken sandwich?)

The rest of the 'wich didn't fare much better, as all the components were either offensively bland or way too soft. The lack of texture was pretty much disastrous, and I ultimately found that the sandwich reminded me a *lot* of the chicken burger at Burger King.

The onion rings fared even worse, if that's possible. They, too, were super soggy and without any deep-fried deliciousness, and the breading was tasteless and underwhelming. Also, the rings came with ketchup, which is just such an amateur mistake I don't even have the worse.

Food value = Terrible.  All the dishes were tiny.  The only person that got full of their order was my tiny son.  Even a skinny average heighted woman with a small appetite wasn't full.  They took so long with our food, we couldn't afford the time to get another order in.   The menu/restaurant should offer these as ""regular"" portions, with the opportunity to upsize to ""large"" (by that, I mean regular) for $x.  Instead, I'm just frustrated and angry over being fed like a child.

I wanted to make sure I gave this place a fair review, therefore I visited for both breakfast and a Sunday roast dinner to ensure it got it's proper due.

What lured us into this establishment was ""the full english breakfast"".  To my poor boyfriend's (who is British) surprise, the english breakfast did disappoint.  The beans were not Heinz, the mushrooms were mixed into the beans, the bacon was an American style bacon, the black pussing was mediocre and the sausage was a run of the mill sausage...not a proper English sausage.  My corn beef hash was ok...I was expecting the potatoes to be smaller...like a proper hash but they were quartered at best.  Therefore, breakfast was a not return for us.  

When I booked the reservation for breakfast, I also noticed they do a proper Sunday roast dinner therefore I made a reservation for that as well.  Back we went for our Sunday roast.  The appetiser of the scotch egg was done to a more gourmet style than traditional...which is just a personal preference.  The pork scratchings were really nice....even my boyfriend who doesn't like pork scratchings enjoyed them.  The roast was a sirloin roast that was cooked nice.  The roasted potatoes were mediocre and the yorkshire pudding was excellent.  We noticed they had a sticky toffee pudding which is always a must for us.  Again, personal preference on this one as well....I enjoy a golden syrup on my sticky toffee pudding and this one was served with a black treacle.

The service was average at best.  The place was not busy and when we get our appetisers before our soft drinks, there is a bit of an issue with that.  

Will we be back...we will probably give it another try as we saw a great plate of fish and chips being delivered to another customer...but it will not be a constant in our rotation of restaurants for breakfast.",2019-04-01 18:33:23

There are many feasting choices that have varying minimums (8 for prime rib roast, for example). 

The feasts are served family-style, and came with lots of sides, gravy and veg, and a plate of excellent Yorkshire puddings. 

There is a private room available that is best suited to a group of 10 or less (allowing you to draw the curtain), but we squeezed 12 in with the curtain open. 

The roast itself was very good: good meat, well seasoned and cooked proper rare. It is expensive (about $39pp, but the traditional roast also looked good in Yelp pics and about $10pp less), but we got a lot, and there was no fee to bring an outside cake, which could save you a ton over buying everyone a dessert (with 10 people, that could add $100!). The other alternative we'd considered was ""House on parliament"" which is quite a bit less (under $25pp and includes dessert), but not prime rib and no reservations.

The hand pulled rotating cask ale is the way to go for a drink: it's larger (20oz) and a little better deal ($8.75) than many of the other options, and a hand-pulled drink isn't something you find many places, so must-try (the beer is less gassy, and pours with a nice head - made for feasting!)

We choose this place for Easter Sunday Lunch as we wanted a comforting roast dinner!  We were sat downstairs among other restaurant goers and to our dismay, when we were greeted by the waitress, we were handed a Brunch menu. This was obviously our own fault and we should have done more research as we were hoping for a varied British lunch menu for a special Easter Sunday meal. 
Nonetheless, we decided to stay and dine at this eatery as we were both hangry and thankfully, there was a Roast of the Day option on the Brunch menu to satisfy our Spud, Meat and Veg needs. 
Priced at $29, the dish certainly fell on the more expensive side, I mean, you might expect these prices on a  dinner menu, but Brunch? 
We were served our drinks straight away and it was about a 20 minute wait for said roast to appear under our nostrils and once it arrived, we both knew it would be devoured in a matter of minutes. We were given (and this is not an exaggeration) one thick cut of roast beef (we expected at least 2 or 3 slices for the price), two baby roast potatoes, and about 4 string beans and 4 - 5 chunks of carrot (which were under cooked) served with a Yorkshire pud on the side and a miserable drizzle of gravy. 
The waitress came over to check if we needed anything else and my partner politely indicated that the serving size was poor and we would appreciate more sides with our dish. She did not hesitate once she saw our plates, and swiftly returned back with a small side plate of roast potatoes (she must have forgotten about the veg) 
All in all it was an occasion so we decided not to dwell too much on the meal and asked for the desert menu which looked fantastic.
We both opted to share the Sticky Toffee Pud served with a scoop of vanilla Ice-cream and two Breakfast Tea's on the side, and we were not disappointed. 
Overall the meal came to about $120 with tip which was a little more than we intended to spend for Sunday lunch.

I wasn't excited to come here for a group lunch simply because of the uninspired menu similar to a lot of other places in that area. It's the type of restaurant that does a decent job of the classics (burgers, salads) but nothing you will be in a hurry to try again. 

Tried the tuna ceviche with nacho chips as a starter which was just ok. The mushroom and goat cheese ""purses"" were just ok as well.

The unfortunate thing is that this restaurant had potential - the aesthetic is fun and funky and the seating is super comfortable.

In my case, I noticed the Aperol spritz that I had planned to order was $7 more expensive than it said it was online. When I brought it to the waiter's attention, his response was ""I know nothing about that"". Expecting him to send the manager over, the table and I ordered our drinks (2 cans of beer, 2 cans of cider - switching my order after seeing the prices). We then waited 15 MINUTES to be served CANNED drinks. When the waiter came by for round two and a manager hadn't visited the table yet, we asked for the bill and I took matters into my own hands. I approached the manager and informed her that her menu prices in restaurant and online were different. She was shocked, and thanked me...calling her ""menu guy"" while I was still next to her and informing him of the mistakes. After getting off of the phone, she sent me on my way. No complimentary drink. No honouring of the prices I saw online. No apology. Just a thank you - for covering her ass after something she should've reviewed herself when the website went live...but it gets better. I ended up informing the waiter that I spoke with the manager, and obviously pissed off, he began to argue with my table about how good the drink prices are, and how it isn't cheaper anywhere else in the area. He handed me a menu and asked me to GIVE HIM AN EXAMPLE of a better drink deal in the area. I told him that I wasn't interested in arguing, we paid for our drinks, and headed to a bar down the road where the drinks were cheaper, and the service was much much better. The cherry on top was that my boyfriend was charged twice for our drinks. Do not recommend, will not go back. The menu prices online now match the menu prices in-restaurant, you're welcome.

I would have to say, the service was constant and nothing short of amazing. They got us drinks quickly, they provided the food as soon as it was ready and kept checking back at our area at least every 20 minutes to make sure we were ok (and to take away any cups we had finished with)
The nachos were average. The vanilla ice cream was worth its value and the chocolate lava cake had a little too much ice cream in my opinion, but was delicious!

Everything we had was great, starting with their epic mixed drinks and draft beers. As for appetizers, they had plenty ... but we were saving room for dessert (more on that later!)

I got their PBJ Fingers. To call them ""fingers"" doesn't do them justice ... unless they are based on the size of Andre the Giant's fingers. And, wow, the taste! The perfect mix of Spicy Thai peanut sauce, spicy chili jelly, and cilantro, with the perfect deep-fried chicken.

Came here after a birthday dinner at a nearby sushi place. 

We had a group of 8 people and only 4 of us were ordering drinks since we mainly wanted to get a few rounds for the birthday boy. That's when the waitress got upset and rudely demanded that all of us had to order at least 1 drink in order to stay. I had never heard of this rule before and neither has my girlfriend who is a local server. Even so, I would understand if the venue was packed and we were taking up too many spots, but this was not the case as it was far from capacity.

After that, she took a considerably long time to deliver our drinks (beer on tap). We tried to let it go and not let one negative interaction ruin the rest of our night. However, when it came time to settle we noticed that she added an 18% tip onto all of our bills and conveniently didn't mention it. I understand that it is customary to add gratuity to the bill for groups of 6 or larger, but I believe the standard is 15%. So it was quite presumptuous of her to assume above average service.

The most upsetting part is that we all got the impression that she felt she could finesse us and get away with it. I'd imagine this isn't the first time she's behaved this way and I hope it's not representative of the service level for the rest of Duke's staff. Either way it dampened the birthday boys night.

The black pudding never came and I wouldn't have had it anyway. Now, the bacon.. it was definitely not good bacon nor what you would've expected. The sausage was more on a chorizo side and disgusting and the beans were definitely not Heinz or cooked well enough.

1. They were sold out of everything. Not once were.we informed of any of the sold out items (and there were quite a few).
2. They didn't have a server on site, so they pulled a hostess who (though very sweet) had no clue about the menu, messed up orders and couldnt recommend anything.
3. The ""managing partner "" (though I think he was our bartender) tried to make it seem like it was our fault because we ""didn't show up earlier"" and he ""didn't know it was a birthday dinner"". He clearly couldnt take ownership. It was probably ly the worst part of the night.
4. They tried to charge my friend 50% of a 40$ bill for tip
5. After trying to resolve the multiple issues that came up, they still lied to us. The managing.g partner was very much uncooperative in giving his title or any information to connect him to the evening (or to this review). We were lucky to get his name.

My bf and I were super excited to try this place upon hearing that they had some REALLY awesome chicken fingers and cool vibes. When we got there we were very impressed with the interior 80s vibe and all the decor. We found the menus very cool as they resembled records. The beer selection was also great here. We ordered the onion rings to start but found them to be a little overcooked with too much batter and not enough onion. As our main I ordered the chicken fingers which were fantastic and a garden salad as my side which was horrible IMO (totally regret not getting the fries). My bf ordered the beef tacos which were overpriced with 3 small tacos. The tacos themselves had limited toppings...pretty basic with just meat and lettuce..so he obviously was hungry afterwards. Our main issue with this place would be the server who was not very attentive and forgetful. Our first issue with the server was that he did not really give my bf time to order or really look at the menu. As soon as I ordered my food he immediately asked my bf what he wanted even though he wasn't really ready to order. In addition, he forgot to bring us a beer that we ordered and took a while to bring drinks despite it not being very busy. The worst part was that he did not clear our table throughout the night despite it being very obvious that we were done. For example, he did not clear the empty onion ring tower stand prior to giving us our main courses so it sat there the whole time along with dirty plates. Overall, this place had great chicken fingers but all the other food was mediocre and the service sucked.

The shared plates - was a perfect amount of food for us. The nachos were filling and generous. The calamari was just like any other calamari dish in the city, nothing special. The French fries were extra fried so it was like eating oily crackers (if well done fries peaks your interest). The buttermilk fried chicken came with Mac and cheese, which I found better than the fried chicken itself. Extremely bread-y with little meat.

The Caesar salad - was weak in my opinion. Something about it didn't sit well in my stomach (it was hard to eat). I would've preferred a stronger Caesar dressing, more Parmesan, and no capers. It was a good size on its own.

The food was super disappointing, portions are really small, and the food is not inexpensive or impressive. I ordered the fried chicken, and in hindsight, I definitely should have gone to Popeye's two blocks down. The mac and cheese was adequate, but everything was luke warm and deflated. 

We also got charged for drinks that were not ours. When we pointed this out to our waitress, she was nice, but only offered to give us cash, and not other apology was really offered. In such a cutthroat market (aka. the Toronto bar scene), I definitely expected more. 

I will say, their pretty patio, and cocktail mason jars win them major hipsters points, but I don't know if I'll be rushing back anytime soon.",2019-06-24 19:18:19

Always liked this pub but the service last night let us down.  We were not advised what the special was; we had to ask.  We asked for water; never came.  When our drinks were finished there was no ""would you like another?""; we had to stop server to ask. Observed other patrons having to go to bar to ask for bill or service while server was busy talking.  Disappointing.",2019-02-18 15:31:02

Why? Bad service, low quality food 
Pros: beautiful interior and design, great patio. 
The rest was just bad 
Cons: everything else except for the decor and ambiance and the patio 

I had the worst service and the worse fish and chips I've ever had. Server was ver rude, she was not happy that she had to serve us, not only we were not welcomed, but we could tell, she didn't want to have anyone there. I can't think of an experience as bad as what we had there in years. 
She was not responsive and only wanted us to place an order quickly when they didn't even have an updated menu. Whatever we asked for she said they are changing the menu and it's either not available or she does not know. When we wanted to order wine, she even refused to help, and just kept saying I don't know, our menu is changing! She brought the bill half way through our meal, we asked for water couple of times, and did not receive it, and the Icelandic cod and chips was the worst fish and chips I ever had. It was the low quality frozen fish, nothing Icelandic about it lol 
The fries was cold and not tasty, there was barely any fish and mostly deep fried batter which tasted like bad old frying oil. I could only have a bite and although I was super hungry, I preferred not to put those stuff into my body! Lol
I went there with my colleague to see if this would be a good place for our corporate event, and it turned out to be a disappointing experience. My colleague ordered the poke bowl, he also couldn't finish as the fish was not fresh.",2019-10-12 13:48:12

After the first wave of people had given it their initial try and the hype has died down, Pick 6ix has re-branded as an upscale sports bar, located right in the heart of Toronto's Financial District.

I respect that the owner(s) of Pick 6ix didn't half-ass their transformation to a sports bar - there are PLENTY of TV screens to catch the game, and the general atmosphere of the establishment is markedly more casual. It's actually a pretty decent place to catch the big game, so long as you're not expecting a place where ""everybody knows your name"". The beer/wine/cocktail selection is pretty formidable, and the traditional pub fare that you'd expect in a sports bar is all there in the menu (think: nachos, burgers, chicken wings).

It's personally not my cup of tea, but if you work on Bay Street and you happen to get out of the office JUST in time for the big game, Pick 6ix is probably going to be your best bet.",2019-05-13 21:13:29
